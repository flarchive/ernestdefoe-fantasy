/**
 * Scoring rules that make sense in the sport being played.
 *
 * 🚨 The RULES are the same in every sport and the NUMBERS are not, which is
 * the whole of this file. Points scored, points allowed, margin of victory, a
 * win, a shutout and an upset are all meaningful whether the game is football
 * or hockey. But a football team scores about thirty points a game, a
 * basketball team about a hundred and ten, and a football — the other kind —
 * team about one and a half. A rate of 1.0 per point is a sensible week in
 * gridiron, an absurd 110-point week in basketball, and rounding error in
 * soccer.
 *
 * So a new league starts from its own sport's numbers. Everything stays
 * editable: a commissioner who wants football's rates in a basketball league
 * can have them, and nothing here overrides a league that already exists.
 *
 * 🚨 The defaults below are calibrated so a typical starting lineup scores
 * roughly the same TOTAL in any sport — around a hundred points a week for four
 * starters. That is what makes two leagues on the same forum comparable, and
 * what stops a basketball league's standings reading like a phone number.
